# Changelog

> This fork resets its changelog at the ICE rename. Pre-fork release history lives upstream at https://github.com/earendil-works/pi.

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the package to `@zykairotis/ice-agent-core` and removed the previous package specifier.
- Renamed public API symbols to `Ice*`/`ice*`.
- Replaced the legacy harness session model with the v4 lane-based `Session`, `SessionStorage`, and `SessionRepo` APIs, including durable operation records, global facts, shared sequence numbers, and tree-scoped lane views.
- Promoted the v2 session and `AgentHarness` API from the experimental entrypoint to the default package export and removed the experimental subpaths.
- Removed the legacy JSONL and in-memory repository APIs. `InMemorySessionRepo` is the reference v4 repository; JSONL v4 support will use the new `SessionRepo` contract.

### Added

- Added bounded `Session.findEntriesOnBranch()` and `findEntryOnBranch()` queries with explicit traversal, filtering, ordering, and limit options.
- Added a compile-complete `AgentHarness` v2 scaffold; unfinished operation paths reject with `HarnessNotImplemented` while durable execution is implemented.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows path handling for `NodeExecutionEnv` file basenames, recursive skill loading, and prompt template names.
